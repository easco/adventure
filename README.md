Adventure
=========

The purpose of this project is to explore concepts of state handling in functional languages, and in particular, in Elixir.

The conceit of the piece is an implementation of the adventure game from ["Casting SPELs in LISP"](http://www.lisperati.com/casting.html) and the ["Land of LISP"](http://landoflisp.com) by Conrad Barski.  It was used here without permission, but with the sincere hope that flattery might buy forgiveness.

An adventure game was chosen because state manipulation is an important part of many types of games, this one included. Make no mistake, however, the goal is not implement the game, but to have a playground in which to play with Elixir and OTP concepts and constructs.

The source code in this repository is publicly available without any representations as to it's suitability for any purpose by any person (even the Author). Caveat Emptor.
